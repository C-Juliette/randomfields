This package considers randomly generated matrix as maps. It plots the
maps and indicates the variance and the distribution of a realization.
It does moving average to generate new maps which are spatially
structured. It calculates the covariance between points on spatial
structured maps. And it subsamples maps, with or without an average of
the neighbored points.
